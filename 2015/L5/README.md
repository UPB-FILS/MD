**todo** - Single Page Web Application with Framework 7. May be distributed as SPA WA, CouchApp - with a couple of changes or Hybrid application. This application uses PouchDB so it will work off-line, sync with any on-line CouchDB compatible database (replication protocol), like Cloudant, CouchBase, IrisCouch (EOL site), SmileUpps

**xdkToDO** - Hybrid ToDO application build with Framework 7 using Intel XDK. The pluging Couchbase Lite will not compile for Android - please remove it before building the application.
Also it uses PouchDB as local database, so you can replicate and synchronize with any on-line BigCouch server (see above a list of on-line servers and solutions).
